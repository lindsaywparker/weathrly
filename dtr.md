# Project: Weatherly

### Group Member Names:
* Lindsay Parker and JC

### Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
* Hoping to learn more about API's, React and design. Let's NOT be confused by API's and feel very comfortable with React so that we feel prepared for Mod 3. At the end of this project, it would be great to feel like we were a good pair to tackle this project. Communicate early will be our motto.

### Goals and expectations:
* We want to work well as a team, and follow this DTR successfully. Much of that will come down to communication, and being on the same page with how we will approach tackling the work (driver/navigator vs divide/conquer).

### Team strengths:
* Organized (totally Lindsay), big picture thinking, strong work ethic, similar communication styles.

### How to overcome obstacles:
* Identify that it is an obstacle and bring it up with one another. If the obstacle is technical, some level of struggle is good, but we should not let an obstacle block us for longer than an hour before asking for help.

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
* Lindsay (at school by 8am, up until 5:30pm at school, and then after 7pm as needed)
* Jason (at school by 8am, and anytime after school for as long as is needed)

### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
* Communication will happen daily, multiple times per day. We will leverage Slack and SMS for getting in touch about items. Every two days we will sit down and have a quick feedback session to make sure we're meeting the DTR commitments and supporting one another as a team. We'll do a daily stand-up at the earliest convenient time each day to check in on new roadblocks encountered, updates to work completed, etc.

### Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
* Covered in above bullet points.

### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
* Aiming for an equal workload distribution so that we both have ample opportunity to learn throughout this project.

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
* Keep master pristine, do feature and bug work in branches. Use PR's. We'll work with a TDD approach as much as possible, but we understand there will be challenges since we've never tested React before.

### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
* Immediate feedback should be given so that things don't fester.

### Agenda to discuss project launch:
* Saturday, May 27th. Initial breakdown of work for the first 3 phases, with cards added to the project tracking tool.

### Ideas:
* TBD

### Tools:
* Our brains. And Waffle for project tracking.
